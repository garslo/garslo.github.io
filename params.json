{"name":"Inconsistency!","tagline":"Why math is so fuzzy.","body":"### Math is True, Right?\r\nMany people are drawn to math because they perceive it as certain, that it has some undeniable \"truthy\" quality to it. It's in our culture: \"just do the math\", we say; \"it's been proven mathematically\", we reassure ourselves. If the math's done right, we feel pretty good about a thing's truth value.\r\n\r\nMathematicians (and lots of other kinds of people) see things a little differently. This all varies with respect to philosophical bent, but the general gist is that we can only have truth within a context. For example: 1 + 1 = 2, right? That seems obvious, but we really can't say \"true\" unless we know the context. Are we talking about stones? Well, then yes, 1 stone + 1 stone = 2 stones. What if we're talking about drops of water? That's interesting: if I stick two drops together, I get one drop. So 1 drop + 1 drop = 1 drop, and 1 + 1 = 1. (There are mathematical structures parroting these things as well).\r\n\r\n### Truth is Contextual?\r\nBack to our original idea: we can talk about truth within a context. Let's call this the **First Important Point**: truth has a context to it. In math, that context is defined by assumptions, things we aren't allowed to prove or disprove. I might set up a context where the only things I can work with are the numbers 0 and 1, and I can only add things together. The usual way of defining addition on for this structure allows us to say that 1 + 1 = 0, and that would be true *in this context*.\r\n\r\n### A Generalization\r\nAs it happens, mathematicians have constructed the rest of math in exactly the same way: *everything* in mathematics can be traced back to some collection of assumptions. We'll call this the **Second Important Point**: every bit of math relies on assumptions, things we aren't allowed to prove but *have to* take as absolutely true (but stay tuned, there are qualifications).\r\n\r\nOof, this is getting long; we'll press on regardless.\r\n\r\n### Extra Points for Composition!\r\nIf we combine the **First Important Point** with the **Second Important Point**, we get a **Third Important Point**: the **Second Important Point** is kind of wrong. Sure, everything relies on assumptions, but how can we say those assumptions are true? Well, we'd need a context for them to be true, but that context would require some assumptions. And so we have a nice little circle of illogic. So, we forget about the whole truth idea and focus on something else entirely: consistency. And we have the **Fourth Important Point**: we only care about consistency.\r\n\r\n### Don't be a Hypocrite\r\nConsistency is all about not contradicting yourself. Humans are NOT consistent :) we contradict ourselves all the time. That, I think, is the primary motivation for math: we need math to be consistent because we are not. So, we need to make sure that our contexts (the assumptions and objects) can't contain contradictions. It's a daunting task, but thankfully we can focus only on the assumptions to make sure contradictions are not possible.\r\n\r\nAt least, that's what everyone thought for a few hundred years; but then Kurt GÃ¶del came along. There's a lot more to it, but he *proved*, incontrovertibly, that you can't prove a system's consistency. Take a step back to appreciate that: we started liking math because we thought it was true. Well, I guess we can't *really* say that. But at least it's consistent, right? I can still hold onto that. Well, you really can't know that either. Oh. If you're not sufficiently prepped for that, it can be quite crushing :)\r\n\r\n### Finally!\r\nWe're finally in a position to appreciate the lament that started this whole ordeal: \"Every morning I look at the sky and say to myself: 'ZF is consistent'. Then I go to work.\" To begin, ZF refers to the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms, the assumptions which underly set theory, and which in turn are the basic blocks of nearly all mathematics. We have here a basic tragedy: we expected truth, but got none. Being well-adjusted individuals, we were willing to settle for consistency, but, as happens often in philosophy, were crushed by dead white German men. So we're left with a thin husk of mathematics and a mathematician who is hanging onto his sanity by a leap of faith. \"It *must* be consistent,\" and with steely resolve, begins doing mathematics.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
