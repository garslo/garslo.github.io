<a name="math-is-true-right" class="anchor" href="#math-is-true-right"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Math is True, Right?</h3>

<p>Many people are drawn to math because they perceive it as certain, that it has some undeniable "truthy" quality to it. It's in our culture: "just do the math", we say; "it's been proven mathematically", we reassure ourselves. If the math's done right, we feel pretty good about a thing's truth value.</p>

<p>Mathematicians (and lots of other kinds of people) see things a little differently. This all varies with respect to philosophical bent, but the gist is that we can only have truth within a context. For example: 1 + 1 = 2, right? That seems obvious, but we really can't say "true" unless we know the context. Are we talking about stones? Well, then yes, 1 stone + 1 stone = 2 stones. What if we're talking about drops of water? That's interesting: if I stick two drops together, I get one drop. So 1 drop + 1 drop = 1 drop, and 1 + 1 = 1. (There are mathematical structures parroting these things as well).</p>

<h3>
<a name="truth-is-contextual" class="anchor" href="#truth-is-contextual"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Truth is Contextual?</h3>

<p>Back to our original idea: we can talk about truth within a context. Let's call this the <strong>First Important Point</strong>: truth has a context to it. In math, that context is defined by assumptions, things we aren't allowed to prove or disprove. I might set up a context where the only things I can work with are the numbers 0 and 1, and I can only add things together. The usual way of defining addition on for this structure allows us to say that 1 + 1 = 0, and that would be true <em>in this context</em>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="a-generalization" class="anchor" href="#a-generalization"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A Generalization</h3>

<p>As it happens, mathematicians have constructed the rest of math in exactly the same way: <em>everything</em> in mathematics can be traced back to some collection of assumptions. We'll call this the <strong>Second Important Point</strong>: every bit of math relies on assumptions, things we aren't allowed to prove but <em>have to</em> take as absolutely true (but stay tuned, there are qualifications).</p>

<p>Oof, this is getting long; we'll press on regardless.</p>

<h3>
<a name="extra-points-for-composition" class="anchor" href="#extra-points-for-composition"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extra Points for Composition!</h3>

<p>If we combine the <strong>First Important Point</strong> with the <strong>Second Important Point</strong>, we get a <strong>Third Important Point</strong>: the <strong>Second Important Point</strong> is kind of wrong. Sure, everything relies on assumptions, but how can we say those assumptions are true? Well, we'd need a context for them to be true, but that context would require some assumptions. And so we have a nice little circle of illogic. So, we forget about the whole truth idea and focus on something else entirely: consistency. And we have the <strong>Fourth Important Point</strong>: we only care about consistency.</p>

<h3>
<a name="dont-be-a-hypocrite" class="anchor" href="#dont-be-a-hypocrite"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't be a Hypocrite</h3>

<p>Consistency is all about not contradicting yourself. Humans are NOT consistent :) we contradict ourselves all the time. That, I think, is the primary motivation for math: we need math to be consistent because we are not. So, we need to make sure that our contexts (the assumptions and objects) can't contain contradictions. It's a daunting task, but thankfully we can focus only on the assumptions to make sure contradictions are not possible.</p>

<p>At least, that's what everyone thought for a few hundred years; but then Kurt GÃ¶del came along. There's a lot more to it, but he <em>proved</em>, incontrovertibly, that you can't prove a system's consistency. Take a step back to appreciate that: we started liking math because we thought it was true. Well, I guess we can't <em>really</em> say that. But at least it's consistent, right? I can still hold onto that. Well, you really can't know that either. Oh. If you're not sufficiently prepped for that, it can be quite crushing :)</p>

<h3>
<a name="finally" class="anchor" href="#finally"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Finally!</h3>

<p>We're finally in a position to appreciate the lament that started this whole ordeal: "Every morning I look at the sky and say to myself: 'ZF is consistent'. Then I go to work." To begin, ZF refers to the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms, the assumptions which underly set theory, and which in turn are the basic blocks of nearly all mathematics. We have here a basic tragedy: we expected truth, but got none. Being well-adjusted individuals, we were willing to settle for consistency, but, as happens often in philosophy, were crushed by dead white German men. So we're left with a thin husk of mathematics and a mathematician who is hanging onto his sanity by a leap of faith. "It <em>must</em> be consistent," and with steely resolve, begins doing mathematics.</p>
